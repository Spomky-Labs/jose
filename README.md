This library provides an implementation of:

* JW**S** [JSON Web Signature (RFC 7515)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515),
* JW**T** [JSON Web Token (RFC 7519)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
* JW**E** [JSON Web Encryption (RFC 7516)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7516),
* JW**A** [JSON Web Algorithms (RFC 7518)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7518).
* JW**K** [JSON Web Key (RFC 7517)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517).
* JSON Web Key Thumbprint ([RFC 7638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7638)).
* Unencoded Payload Option [RFC7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797).

# Provided Features

## Supported Input Types:

JWS or JWE objects support every input that can be encoded into JSON:

* [x] `string`, `array`, `integer`, `float`...
* [x] Objects that implement the `\JsonSerializable` interface such as `JWKInterface` or `JWKSetInterface`

The [detached content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#appendix-F) is also supported.

Unencoded payload is supported. This means you can sign and verify payload without base64 encoding operation.
As per the [RFC7797](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7797), the `b64` header MUST be protected.
When `b64` header is set, the `crit` protected header with value `b64` in its array of values is mandatory.

## Supported Serialization Modes

* [x] Compact JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)
* [x] Flattened JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)
* [x] General JSON Serialization Syntax (JWS/JWE creation and loading)

# The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

# Prerequisites

This library needs at least:
* ![PHP 5.6+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-5.6%2B-ff69b4.svg),
* OpenSSL extension.

Please consider the following optional requirements:
* For AES-GCM based algorithms (`AxxxGCM` and `AxxxGCMKW`) if not on PHP 7.1+: [PHP Crypto](https://github.com/bukka/php-crypto) Extension (at least `v0.2.1`) is highly recommended as encryption/decryption is faster than the pure PHP implementation.
* For Ed25519 algorithm: [php-ed25519-ext](https://github.com/encedo/php-ed25519-ext) required
* For X25519 algorithm: [php-curve25519-ext](https://github.com/encedo/php-curve25519-ext) required

Please read performance test results below concerning the ECC based algorithms.
As the time needed to perform operation is long compared to the other algorithms, we do not recommend their use.

# Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 5.6`, `PHP 7.0`, `PHP 7.1` and `HHVM` with all algorithms.

Tests vectors from the [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are fully implemented and all tests pass.

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Spomky-Labs/JOSE) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/9123fbfc-7ae1-4d63-9fda-170b8ad794ee).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/22874677).

Code coverage is analyzed by [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/Spomky-Labs/jose).
